To test the functionality of the designed ALU module and view the results, make sure that `Make` and `Icarus Verilog` are properly installed on your machine. Then, put `ALU.v`, `test_ALU.v`, and `Makefile` under your working directory and run the following command:

```bash
make
```
To remove the test output, run:
```bash
clean
```
