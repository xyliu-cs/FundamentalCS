# FundamentalCS
Welcome to `FundamentalCS`, a collection of projects showcasing fundamental concepts in Computer Science and their real-world implementations. The projects encompass a spectrum from elementary to advanced levels, implemented in various languages such as `C`, `C++`, `Verilog`, `Python`, `Cuda`, and even `Assembly`.

Most projects in this repository are adapted from the course projects during my undergraduate study. Each project offers a hands-on experience with the fundamental principles and practical applications of computer science. While most of the projects are in a functional state and can pass the provided test suites, a few harbor minor bugs, which I expect to fix in the future. 

This repository will be consistently maintained and updated until all the undergraduate-level CS courses and relevant projects are completed. The prefix (words before the first hyphen) for the projects indicates the related course and CS area. So far, it has: 

* **OS**: Operating Systems
* **CompArch**: Computer Architecture

`FundamentalCS` repository is created to reflect my ongoing journey in the exploration of Computer Science fundamentals as an undergraduate student. It encourages people to dive in to explore, learn, and contribute to the world of Computer Science.

## Project Structure
Each folder at the root level represents a **standalone** project. To run and test the projects, please refer to the `report.pdf` attached to the project folder, where the running environment is specified.

## Academic Integrity
If you happen to be my fellow students and recognize some of the projects, you're welcome to peruse the codes and provide feedback. However, to improve your own coding skills, you should do the design and coding **on your own**.
