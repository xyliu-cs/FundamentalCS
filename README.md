# FundamentalCS
Welcome to `FundamentalCS`, a collection of projects showcasing fundamental concepts in Computer Science and their real-world implementations. The projects encompass a spectrum from elementary to advanced levels, implemented in various languages such as `C`, `C++`, `Verilog`, `Python`, `Cuda`, and even `Assembly`.

Most projects in this repository are adapted from the course projects during my undergraduate study. Each project offers a hands-on experience with the fundamental principles and practical applications of computer science. While most of the projects are in a functional state and can pass the provided test suites, a few harbor minor bugs, which I expect to fix in the future. 

This repository will be consistently maintained and updated until all the undergraduate-level CS courses and relevant projects are completed. The prefix (characters before the first hyphen) for the projects denotes the related course and CS branch. So far, it has: 

* **OS**: Operating Systems
* **CompArch**: Computer Architecture

`FundamentalCS` repository is created to reflect my ongoing journey in the exploration of Computer Science fundamentals as an undergraduate student. It encourages people to dive in to explore, learn, and contribute to the world of Computer Science.

## Project Structure
Each folder at the root level represents a **standalone** project. To run and test the projects, please refer to the `report.pdf` attached to the project folder, where the running environment is specified.

## Academic Integrity
Fellow students who recognize some of the projects are welcome to peruse the codes and provide feedback. However, for academic endeavors, project design and coding should be carried out **independently**.
