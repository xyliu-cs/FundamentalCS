# FundamentalCS
Welcome to `FundamentalCS`, a collection of projects showcasing fundamental concepts in Computer Science and their real-world implementations. The projects encompass a spectrum from elementary to advanced levels, implemented in a diverse array of languages such as `C`, `Verilog`, `Python`, `Cuda`, `Assembly`, and `C++`.  

Most projects in this repository are adapted from the course projects during my undergraduate study. Each project offers a hands-on experience with the fundamental principles and practical applications of computer science. While most of the projects are in a functional state and can pass the provided test suites, a few harbor minor bugs. I expect to fix them in the future. 

This repository will be consistently maintained and updated until all the undergraduate-level CS courses and relevant projects are completed. If you are my fellow student and recognize some of the projects, you're welcome to peruse the codes and provide feedback. However, for the sake of learning, I advise you to do the coding **independently**.

In the end, this repository is created to reflect the ongoing journey in my exploration of Computer Science fundamentals. Dive in to explore, learn, and contribute to the world of Computer Science.
